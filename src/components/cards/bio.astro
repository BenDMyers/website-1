    Who is Jenn Junod?
    </h2>
    <p class='poppins'>I am a developer advocate, international speaker and MC, podcast host, and live streamer.
    As someone who thrives on human connection, I advocate for those who have gone unheard. My passion and experience create a space where people can come together, be it learning live, hosting Sh!t You Don't Want to Talk About Podcast, or being a Developcado (Developer Advocate).
